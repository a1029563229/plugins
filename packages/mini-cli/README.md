Sometimes, we need use the ES6 Syntax, but we don't know how to use `webpack`, and don't want use `vue` or `react`, it's too weight for us.

So, We can use the `shadows-mini-cli` to build a ES6 environment.

At first, we install it.
```bash
npm i shadows-mini-cli -g
```

Then, we can use it like thisï¼š
```bash
mini create <app-name>
```

Enter your created project, use `npm install` and `npm start`, It works!
